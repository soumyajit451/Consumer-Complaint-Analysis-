## About the Data

Complaints that the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) sends to companies for response are published in the Consumer Complaint Database after the company responds, confirms a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first.

## Problem Statement

The lack of complaints or a relatively low number of complaints published in the database about a product, issue, or company does not necessarily mean there is little or no consumer harm. Depending on the nature of the financial product and how consumers use the product, consumers may be harmed in ways that do not cause them to complain to the Bureau or to blame the product or provider for the harm they have suffered.

**Objective:** Design and build a scalable machine learning pipeline to predict if a given consumer complaint will be disputed or not.

## Solution Approach

We aim to use the provided data to create a classification model that can predict whether a consumer complaint will be disputed. This involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather data from the CFPB Consumer Complaint Database.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create relevant features that can improve model performance.
4. **Model Building:** Develop and train a machine learning model.
5. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy the model using a cloud platform and expose it via an API or user interface.

## Proposed Solution

1. **Data Understanding:**
    - Analyze the data to understand the distribution and nature of complaints.
    - Consider firm size, market share, and population demographics when analyzing complaint volumes.

2. **Data Sources:**
    - Download all complaint data in CSV or JSON format.
        - [Download CSV](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/ccdb/complaints.csv.zip)
        - [Download JSON](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/ccdb/complaints.json.zip)

3. **Machine Learning Pipeline:**
    - Preprocess the data to handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
    - Implement feature engineering to enhance model performance.
    - Train and evaluate multiple models to select the best performing one.
    - Deploy the final model using a cloud platform and provide an API for access.

## Project Setup

1. **Environment Setup:**
    - Install required packages using `requirements.txt`.
    - Set up a MySQL database for metadata storage.

2. **Data Preparation:**
    - Download the dataset and place it in the designated directory.
    - Run preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data.

3. **Model Training:**
    - Execute the model training script to build and evaluate the model.

4. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy the model on a cloud platform and expose it via an API or user interface.

## Project Structure

## Evaluation Metrics

1. **Code Quality:**
    - Modular, safe, testable, maintainable, and portable code.
    - Code maintained on a public GitHub repository with a detailed README.
    - Follow coding standards (e.g., PEP 8).

2. **Database Integration:**
    - Use an online MySQL database for metadata storage.

3. **Cloud Deployment:**
    - Deploy the solution using platforms like AWS

4. **API/User Interface:**
    - Expose the solution via an API or create a user interface for model testing.

5. **Logging:**
    - Implement logging for every action performed by the code using the Python logging library.

6. **Ops Pipeline:**
    - Utilize AI ops pipelines for project delivery (e.g., DVC, MLflow).

7. **Deployment:**
    - Host the model on a cloud platform or edge devices, with a proper system design justification.



## Conclusion

This project aims to build a robust and scalable machine learning pipeline to predict whether a consumer complaint will be disputed. By following the steps outlined above, we ensure a comprehensive approach to data handling, model building, and deployment, ultimately providing a valuable tool for analyzing consumer complaints.
